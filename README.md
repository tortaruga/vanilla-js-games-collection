## overview

Collection of games made with vanilla js. remake of an [old exercise](https://github.com/tortaruga/vanilla-js-games); although design is still not my strongest suit, I think there's an improvement.

#### games

*(for more details on each project click the links.)*
The games featured are: 

- [Tic tac toe](https://github.com/tortaruga/tic-tac-toe): supports solo play against computer, 2 players (on the same device), and the computer play against itself... I don't kow why. I got the idea while implementing the minimax algorithm for the computer's move, and *"AI battle!"* was suddenly all I could think about. 
- [15 puzzle](https://github.com/tortaruga/15puzzle): it features a move counter and a timer, and the colors of the tiles are randomly generated. This makes the design considerably prettier than last time, and also considerably sneakier to code. I almost started to regret the idea, but I think it enhanced the project, and it also made it possible to animate the tile swap.
- [whack-a-mole](https://github.com/tortaruga/whackamole): this time I tried to make it look a bit more fun, compared to the minimal and quite sad design of the original version. I used an illustration to represent the mole tile, and also included a background music and a game-over sound effect. 
- [snake](https://github.com/tortaruga/snake-game): the game can be played both on computer through keyboard and on mobile through some arrow buttons. Here too I added background music and sound effects, as well as some cute snake illustrations.
- [rock paper scissors](https://github.com/tortaruga/rock-paper-scissors-frontend-mentor): this project was a [frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH) challenge, as you can notice from the design being better than anything I could have come up with; I added some simple animations to make it a bit more dynamic. As well as the design being updated, the project also features a bonus version (rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock), and a score board (the score gets saved into local storage so that it's not lost on refreshing the page).
